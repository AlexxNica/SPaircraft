Welcome to SPaircraft's documentation!
=================================

SPaircraft is a signomial programming (SP) compatible, system-level aircraft optimization framework. It is inspired by Prof. Mark Drela's TASOPT, and includes many models from the work as well as a number of models developed within the Hoburg Research Group. 

SPaircraft has been developed by Berk Ozturk and Martin York, who are both graduate students at MIT in the Aerospace Computational Design Lab.
